# mysql_app - Rails 3 and MySQL 5.5 application for Rock'n'Swap.com created on OS X Lion

This project was created on OSX Lion and uses Rails 3.1 and MySQL 5.5 (64-bit). It utilizes the 'mysql2' gem (https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2) by Brian Lopez for interaction with a localhost MySQL instance.

## First steps:

### Run the setup script:
``` sh
./setup.sh
```

## Development

I have tried to connect to and external source (1and1.com), but get an error that it is not a valid MySQL server. ?!?
